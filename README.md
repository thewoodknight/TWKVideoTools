# TWK Video Tools

## SRT-To-TTS 
Takes subtitles (SRT), runs them through Google Clouds Text-to-Speech service to produce individual wav's for each subtitle
Then, creates a FCXMLv9 file so the whole thing can be imported back into your NLE of choice with appropriate timing.

Takes an EDL of markers, then 'converts' it to a Youtube compatible chapter format for videos. Copy and paste this into your video description.

More or less the desktop version of [EDLtoYT](https://github.com/thewoodknight/EDLtoYT) as there was no reason for it to run on the web - it's rare you'll be in front of a NLE but not at a desktop.

## SRT-To-Text
"Flattens" a SRT file to text. Useful for script writing.

## Members CSV To Text
Takes Youtube's Member CSV file and outputs to a (currently predefined) text file output for credits in video
